# Project Euler

This repository holds my solutions for Project Euler problems.

View my progress - https://projecteuler.net/progress=vplagov (visible only for registered users).

Each solution for a given problem is located into a respective class, e.g. `Problem001`, `Problem002`, etc. There's a
test class for each of the solution. Each test class contains a test case with a correct answer to the problem. There
might be also additional test cases to the solution with sample inputs.
